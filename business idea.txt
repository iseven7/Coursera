Business idea

People often find themselves looking a neighborhood to go have a dinner and they decide in the last minute. I would like to divide restaurants in Cleveland, Ohio into 3 clusters. This will lead people create 3 bubbles of strategic locations to be around if they wanna be around different restaurants.

Data

An api call will be made to foursquare to retrieve data of restaurants in Cleveland Ohio within certain miles. The location data and resturants names will be collected in a dataframe. Kmean algorithm will be run to divide these restaurants into clusters.
